# Segnet_tensorflow
This is the lab project in which I successfully implemented Segnet in tersorflow platform and I tested the code with pretrained weights on camvid dataset. And I also tried training with my own weights on camvid dataset with 12 classes. And then I tested it and got results on ramdom dataset from google.
